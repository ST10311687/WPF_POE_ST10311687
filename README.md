# ST10311687 Lee James PROG6221 POE PART 3

## ABOUT
This project can also be found on my GitHub repository: https://github.com/ST10311687/WPF_POE_ST10311687

This WPF project is a recipe application that allows users to enter in deatils for a recipe. These details include the recipe name, ingredient name, quantity of the ingredient, unit of measure ment for the ingredient, amount of calories, which food group the ingredient belongs to and the steps of the recipe. The user can then add another recipe or interact with the othre buttons which allow the recipe to be displayed, scaled, or reset.

## UPDATES

- I have improved my display. When dispalying a recipe the name ingredients and steps and neatly shown and seperated where nessecary
- I have given an explination for the different values of calories entered and also the different types of food groups
- The selection of food groups is now a selection and makes use of a combo box
- Added relevent information that displays to alert the user
- I have added seperator lines between methods, an end-of-file line, and comments throughout all my classes
